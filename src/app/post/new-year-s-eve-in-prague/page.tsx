        <p className="mb-4">
          If you are planning to spend your NYE in Prague and party a little then you have found exactly what you need. At Best Clubs Prague, we give you the best clubs in the city and at the same time the best NYE events.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Here is a little breakdown of some places and the type of events they have on New Year.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">M1 Lounge</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The most expensive NYE on our list as far as tickets are concerned but there is a good reason for that. M1 is always sold out because the music is out of this world. It is sold out EVERY year way in advance. If you like RnB / Hip-Hop, then this is the spot for you.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Epic Prague</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Oh boyyyyy. Epic, the most modern club in Prague has one of the SICKEST NYE party. Epic is HUGE with over 2500m2 of space. You know what that means. Absolutely LEGENDARY type of party with some of the best House / EDM DJs.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">One Club Prague</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One Club and Ace Club are right next to each other. For NYE they combine for a multi stage, multi music genre experience. Definitely not a bad choice to spend your NYE.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We will update this article as more NYE events come out. If they are a good one.... we will let you know!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Onyx Club</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Have you ever partied for 36 hours? Onyx Club is freshly opened in 2022 and has already made our Best Clubs list. It is also one of our recommended clubs to visit on NYE. You can find all the event info <a href="https://goout.net/en/new-years-eve-2023/szvumtu/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Steampunk Prague</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If there is any club that takes themes to the next level it is Steampunk. This year their NYE theme is AVATAR, and it is going to be a blast!
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Are you looking for a different type of fun? How about a strip club?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          After visiting all the strip clubs in Prague (which was fun) we have made our final pick of the best strip club in Prague. That pick is - <a href="https://goldfingers.cz/en?utm_source=bestclubsprague&utm_medium=referral" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldfingers Prague</a>. Unlike other places which felt like a tourist trip, Goldfingers actually values its customers. We actually felt comfortable going there and really enjoyed the night out!
