            The answer is way too many. It seems there is a club on every corner in Prague. 
            This beautiful city has transformed into one of Europe's premier nightlife destinations, 
            with an abundance of venues catering to every taste and preference.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prague even has its own dedicated party street called <strong>Dlouha</strong>, which stretches 
            through the heart of the Old Town. However, here's the insider secret that many visitors don't know: 
            most of the better, higher-quality clubs are actually <em>not</em> located on this famous party street.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Reality of Prague's Club Scene</h2>
          
          <p>
            Walking through Prague, especially in the city center, you'll encounter clubs, bars, and 
            entertainment venues at every turn. The sheer number can be overwhelming for first-time visitors. 
            From massive multi-level complexes to intimate underground venues, Prague's nightlife landscape 
            is incredibly diverse.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-6 my-6 italic text-lg">
            "Prague has over 200 nightlife venues, ranging from world-class superclubs to hidden speakeasies, 
            making it one of the most club-dense cities in Europe."
          </blockquote>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Beyond Dlouha Street</h2>
          
          <p>
            While Dlouha street gets all the attention as Prague's "party street," the reality is that 
            many of Prague's premium clubs are strategically located in other areas:
          </p>

          <ul className="space-y-2 ml-6">
            <li>• <strong>Wenceslas Square area</strong> - Home to several upscale venues</li>
            <li>• <strong>Vinohrady district</strong> - Known for sophisticated cocktail bars and clubs</li>
            <li>• <strong>Karlín</strong> - Emerging nightlife district with trendy venues</li>
            <li>• <strong>Smíchov</strong> - Houses some of the city's largest entertainment complexes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Quality Over Quantity</h2>
          
          <p>
            The key to enjoying Prague's nightlife isn't trying to visit as many clubs as possible, 
            but rather choosing the right venues for your taste and style. Some clubs focus on:

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Recommendation</h2>
          
          <p>
            Instead of wandering Dlouha street with the tourist crowds, we recommend researching 
            and selecting 2-3 quality venues that match your preferences. This approach will give 
            you a much better experience of Prague's legendary nightlife scene.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're looking for underground techno, luxury VIP experiences, or authentic 
            Czech beer halls that transform into late-night party venues, Prague truly has something 
            for everyone. The challenge isn't finding a club – it's choosing the right one.
