        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Where should you spend your Prague NYE 2024/2025?</h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          New Year's Eve is one of the most important nights of the year as far as partying is concerned. Why? For one, just about any place that has some lights and a sound system is going to hold a party and sell out. Most of these places to be honest will have a super <strong>poopy</strong> party (yes we just wrote poopy).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We have already given you the best clubs in Prague and now it is time to let you know where to go on <strong>New Year's Eve</strong> (NYE)! While just about anyone on our list has a great party for NYE there are some particular places that have ALWAYS been a stand out the last few years. We will get to that!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As the year winds down, Prague, a city renowned for hosting some of the best clubs, becomes the ultimate destination to celebrate New Year's Eve. Known for its enchanting Old Town Square and vibrant nightlife, Prague is where the magic of the season and the thrill of partying on NYE come together in a spectacular winter wonderland.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fireworks? What Fireworks?</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Officially, fireworks are a no-go in Prague 1, but let's just say that when midnight strikes, the sky tells a different story. Expect a not-so-secret display of dazzling colors, lighting up the city in open rebellion against the rules.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Stay Warm, Stay Safe</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Don't worry, Prague is super safe. No one will steal any of your things.... <strong>THAT IS A JOKE</strong>. WATCH YOUR STUFF. Do not put any expensive belongings in the cloak room of any club! Keep your valuables close.
        </p>
