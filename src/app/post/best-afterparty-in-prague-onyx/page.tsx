        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Best Afterparty in Prague? We know where!</h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When the sun sets in Prague, a different city comes to life. The City of a Hundred Spires transforms into an urban jungle of vibrant lights, heart-thumping beats, and vivacious crowds. The party scene in Prague is nothing short of legendary, boasting an eclectic mix of clubs and venues that cater to every taste. From the chic and sophisticated to the underground and avant-garde, there's something for everyone.

        <p className="mb-4">
          But what happens when the clock strikes the wee hours, and the last track fades away? For some, this is the end of the night. But for others, the real fun is just getting started. Welcome to the world of afterparties.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Afterparties are a unique part of the nightlife culture, particularly in a city as energetic as Prague. They extend the night, providing a space for partygoers who aren't quite ready to call it a night. Yet, while there are many spots in Prague known for their epic parties, the afterparty scene remains a bit elusive.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The afterparty scene is an entirely different beast. It's here where the party energy morphs into something more intimate, more raw. It's less about the spectacle and more about the connection between like-minded individuals who simply love the music, the vibe, and the night.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our pick for the best afterparty Prague venue? Onyx Club.</h2>
